Final 

All the files should work! For the two pages on my website, I decided to do one that described Japanese food and the other that displayed a table of Japan's tourism statistics. 

For the Food in Japan webpage, I searched up pictures of Japanese food and described them on my webpage.

For the Japan Statistics webpage, I got a raw csv file from Japan Tourism Statistics. I modified the file in python by reading the file as a pandas DataFrame. This allowed me to pivot the table by the Country and the Year. In the original file, it displayed the number of visitors for a country for a given month and year. The japanstatistics.py program pivoted this information to display the number of visitors for a country in a single year (2014-2020).

Below are my citations:
In the foodinjapan.html file, I listed and described different Japanese foods. The photos and some of the descriptions are obtained from this website:
